<h3 align="center">Remote SOC Analyst | Tier-1 | SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh) | EDR (CrowdStrike) | Incident Triage & Threat Hunting | TryHackMe Top 8% </h3>

---

Entry-level Remote SOC Analyst skilled in SIEM monitoring (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh), EDR triage (CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender), incident triage, and threat hunting. Ranked Top 8% on TryHackMe, with hands-on experience in Blue Team workflows, network traffic analysis, phishing detection, and SOC runbook creation.

During my Professional Master’s in Information and Cybersecurity at the University of Dhaka, I completed the CSE 811 Project Work, where I built an AI-powered security monitoring framework using Wazuh, Suricata, Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana, and Python ML models. I also conducted SOC case studies covering brute-force attacks, phishing, and credential misuse, and developed Python security automation tools including a log parser, IOC checker, and a Sigma-to-Wazuh rule converter.

I specialize in identifying suspicious behavior, correlating multi-source logs, and escalating true positives aligned with MITRE ATT&CK, Lockheed Martin Kill Chain, and the Pyramid of Pain. I’m also capable of implementing automated detection and enrichment workflows to reduce analyst workload and improve response times.

Core Skills:
SIEM (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh) • Incident Triage & Response • EDR (CrowdStrike, Microsoft Defender) • Log Analysis (Windows Event Logs, Linux Syslog) • MITRE ATT&CK & SOC Frameworks • Network Traffic Analysis (Wireshark, DNS/HTTP/TLS) • Network Security • VAPT • Web Application Security • Cloud Security • Digital Forensics

Remote-ready, shift-flexible, and committed to defending organizations against evolving cyber threats.
