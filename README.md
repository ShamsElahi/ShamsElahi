<h3 align="center">Cybersecurity | SOC L1 (Blue Team) | TryHackMe Top 8% </h3>

---

I am a Cyber Security Analyst specializing in Blue Team operations, SOC L1 monitoring, SIEM triage, log analysis, threat detection, and incident response. I work with Wazuh, Suricata, Elastic Stack, and Python automation to detect, investigate, and respond to security incidents across network, endpoint, and cloud environments.

During my Master’s in Information and Cyber Security at the University of Dhaka, I designed and deployed an AI-powered cloud security framework for SME environments—integrating Wazuh, Filebeat, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Suricata, and Python-based AI/ML modules to enable automated threat detection and behavioral anomaly analysis.

I have practical experience in SIEM alert triage, threat hunting, phishing analysis, network traffic analysis, Windows/Linux monitoring, malware detection, and incident escalation, following frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, Kill Chain, and Pyramid of Pain.

Core Skills:

SIEM (Wazuh, Elastic Stack)

Log Analysis & Threat Hunting

Network, Endpoint & Cloud Monitoring

Incident Response & Automated Alerts

Python & AI/ML for Cybersecurity

SOC L1 Triage & Investigation Workflows

Ranked in the Top 8% on TryHackMe, I continuously enhance my skills through hands-on Blue Team labs and SOC simulations. I am passionate about building secure, resilient systems and helping organizations defend against evolving cyber threats.

I am actively seeking opportunities as a Security Analyst / SOC Analyst where I can leverage my expertise in SIEM monitoring, threat detection, incident response, and cloud-based security operations.
